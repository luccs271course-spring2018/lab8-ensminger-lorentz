   in=9386
   was=7788
   that=6601
   he=6202
   his=5529
2. TreeMap 2 tests took: .002s
   Hashmap 2 tests took: .001s
   TreeMap took twice the time as hashmap to complete the same processes. Therefore it is less efficient.
3. You must hit ctrl + D the number of times you have scanners, but if you have each of the scanners .getCount methods put the data in the same wordcounter object, then the numbers will still be correct you must just hit ctrl+D the number of scanner objects you have instantiated.
4. It allows the WordCounter class to be evalulated without needing a user to input data in real time. The test suite can be set up beforehand and then tested later.
