2. TreeMap 2 tests took: .002s
   Hashmap 2 tests took: .001s
   TreeMap took twice as long as hashmap to complete the same processes. Therefore TreeMap is less efficient. It is preferable to use HashMap.
3. You must hit ctrl + D for each scanner you have (i.e. the number of times you hit ctrl + D must equal the number of scanners you have), but if you have each scanner's .getCount method put the data in the same wordcounter object, then the numbers will still be correct as long as just hit ctrl+D once for each of scanner objects you have instantiated.
4. It allows the WordCounter class to be evalulated without needing a user to input data in real time. The test suite can be set up beforehand and then tested later.
